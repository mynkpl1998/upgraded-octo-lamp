# V2I

## Installation

We recommend you to use virtual environment like conda for installation. You can get the mini version of conda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). We will use this MiniConda as our base python installation and will do the required installation on top of that. To install the dependencies, run the following commands inside the conda environment

```
conda create -n v2i python=3.6
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
